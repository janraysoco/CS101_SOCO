#1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.

#a. Describe the data.

#The dataset contains 27 respondents, and each person has three variables 
#recorded: shoe size, height, and gender. Shoe size and height are numerical 
#variables, while gender is a categorical factor with two levels 
#(Male and Female). The data reflects basic anthropometric measurements 
#commonly used to compare physical characteristics across groups.

#b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.
#What its result? Show the R scripts.

male_data <- subset(df, gender == "M", select = c(shoe, height, gender))
female_data <- subset(df, gender == "F", select = c(shoe, height, gender))

male_data
female_data

#c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its
#result.

mean_shoe <- mean(df$shoe)
mean_height <- mean(df$height)

mean_shoe
mean_height

#d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?

#Yes. In general, larger shoe sizes tend to appear with greater heights in the 
#dataset. This relationship is expected because shoe size is partly correlated
#with body proportions, and taller individuals typically have larger feet. 
#While this dataset shows a pattern, a statistical method such as correlation analysis #would confirm the strength of the relationship more rigorously.
```

```{r}
#2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to
#factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out
#the factor levels below the actual values.
months_vector <- c(
  "March","April","January","November","January",
  "September","October","September","November","August",
  "January","November","November","February","May","August",
  "July","December","August","August","September","November","February",
  "April"
)
factor_months_vector <- factor(months_vector)
factor_months_vector


#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Inter-
#pret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?

summary(months_vector)
summary(factor_months_vector)

#No. The character vector simply stores text and cannot summarize categories.
#The factor version groups identical values and provides counts, which is more useful for analysis especially for categorical data like months.
#Therefore, the factor is much more useful when studying frequency, patterns, or performing statistical analysis.

#4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.
